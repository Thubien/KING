### 16. UserSetting Model
- **belongsTo** → User (foreign key: user_id)

### 17. UserLoginLog Model
- **belongsTo** → User (foreign key: user_id)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
- All models use global scopes to ensure company-level data isolation
- Company ID is automatically set on creation for security

### 2. Self-Referencing Relationships
- Transaction model has self-referencing relationships for:
  - Transaction matching (matched_transaction_id)
  - Transaction splitting (parent_transaction_id)

### 3. Polymorphic Potential
- CustomerTimelineEvent has related_model and related_id fields for polymorphic relationships
- This allows timeline events to reference any model type

### 4. Pivot Tables
- Partnership acts as a pivot between User and Store with additional attributes:
  - ownership_percentage
  - debt_balance
  - role and permissions

### 5. Through Relationships
- Company can access all transactions through stores (hasManyThrough)
- Company can access all partnerships through stores (hasManyThrough)

## Database Integrity

### Foreign Key Columns Verified
All foreign key columns exist in their respective tables:
- ✅ users.company_id
- ✅ stores.company_id
- ✅ transactions.store_id, created_by, customer_id, etc.
- ✅ customers.company_id, store_id
- ✅ partnerships.store_id, user_id
- ✅ All other foreign keys verified

### Cascade Rules
Most relationships rely on Laravel's soft deletes for data integrity. Consider adding explicit cascade rules for:
- When a Company is deleted → cascade to all related data
- When a Store is deleted → cascade to transactions, partnerships
- When a User is deleted → handle partnerships and transactions appropriately

## Recommendations

1. **Add Cascade Rules**: Consider adding `->onDelete('cascade')` to migrations for critical relationships
2. **Add Indexes**: Ensure all foreign key columns have indexes for performance
3. **Use Eager Loading**: Use `with()` to prevent N+1 queries when loading relationships
4. **Cache Relationships**: Critical relationships like user partnerships are already cached
5. **Add Validation**: Ensure foreign keys are validated before saving

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexed Foreign Keys**: All foreign key columns should have database indexes
2. **Eager Loading**: Use `with()` to load relationships efficiently
3. **Caching**: Partnership and user access data is already cached
4. **Chunking**: For large datasets, use chunking when processing relationships

## Conclusion

The model relationship system is well-designed and comprehensive. All relationships are properly defined with correct foreign keys and inverse relationships. The system uses Laravel best practices including:
- Global scopes for multi-tenancy
- Soft deletes for data preservation
- Caching for frequently accessed relationships
- Proper naming conventions
- Type-hinted relationship methods
